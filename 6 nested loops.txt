# Nested loops refer to the situation where you have one loop inside another loop. 
The inner loop will complete all its iterations before the outer loop finishes one iteration. 
This means that for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will run completely through all its iterations.

# Example: 
rows = int(input("Enter the # of rows: "))
columns = int(input("Enter the # of columns: "))
symbol = input("Enter a symbol to use: ")

for x in range(rows):
   for y in range(columns):
       print(symbol, end="")
   print()
   
# Description:
- The user is prompted to enter the number of rows (rows variable), the number of columns (columns variable), and a symbol (symbol variable) to use for the pattern.
- The outer loop is represented by for x in range(rows):. This loop will iterate rows number of times. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will 
  execute completely.
- The inner loop is represented by for y in range(columns):. This loop will iterate columns number of times. For each iteration of the inner loop, the specified 
  symbol will be printed (print(symbol, end="")).
- The end="" argument in the print() function is used to ensure that the symbols are printed side by side in the same row, without a new line after each symbol.
- After each iteration of the inner loop, the print() function without any arguments is used to move to the next line, creating a new row for the pattern.

# Example Execution:
 - Let's say the user inputs rows = 3, columns = 5, and symbol = "*". The output will be:
 
# Explanation: 
- The program creates a pattern of 3 rows and 5 columns using the '' symbol. 
- The inner loop prints five " symbols in a row, and this process is repeated three times to create three rows of the pattern.
