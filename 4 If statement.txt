In Python, if is a conditional statement that allows you to make decisions based on certain conditions. 
It is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. 
This way, you can control the flow of your program based on the conditions you specify, making your code more flexible and responsive to different situations.
The general syntax of the if statement is as follows:

if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is True
elif condition:
    # Code to be executed if the previous condition was not True and this condition is True
else:
    # Code to be executed if none of the above conditions are True
	
	
#EXAMPLE:
if age >V18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age == 100:
    print("Century age!")
else:
    print("You are a child")
#Here's how the if statement works in practice:
# - If the value of the variable age is greater than 18, it will print "You are an adult".
# - If the value of the variable age is not greater than 18, but it is equal to 100, it will print "Century age!".
# - If the value of the variable age is neither greater than 18 nor equal to 100, it will print "You are a child".
