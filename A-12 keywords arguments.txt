#Keyword arguments:
 - Also known as named arguments or keyword parameters, are a mechanism for passing arguments to a function
   where arguments are assigned using their names (keys) instead of their order.
   ( that allow you to pass arguments to a function by explicitly specifying the parameter names along with their values)
   This allows for more readable and flexible function calls.
 - By using keyword arguments, we can control which arguments are passed to a function and in what order, 
   which can be particularly useful when functions have many arguments with default values, 
   or when we do not want to rely on the order of arguments when calling the function.
 - In Python, you define a function with parameters, and each parameter has a default name. 
   When you call the function, you can provide the arguments using the parameter names followed by an equal sign (=) and the corresponding values.

def greet(name, message):
    print(f"Hello, {name} {message}")

greet(message="kamil", name="kacperczyk")    #Here, you can provide the arguments out of order but assign them using keywords, and it will be displayed as you want.
:OUTPUT "Hello, kacperczyk kamil"
