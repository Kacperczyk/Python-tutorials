 slicing --> create a substring by extracting elements from another string 
           - indexing[]    start:stop:step
           - slice()       start:stop:step
           
           
           

name = "John Kowalski"

first_name = name[:3]       #means: [0:4]      | output: "John"      --> first char is always starting from 0 not from 1, --> ':4' means from first char to fifth char
last_name = name[5:]        #means: [5:end]    | output: "Kowalski"  --> '5:end' means from sixth char till the last char
funky_name = name[::2]      #means: [0:end:2]  | output: "Jh oasi"   --> from first to the last char, every other char
reversed_name = name[::-1]  #means: [0:end:-1] | output: "edoC orB"  --> from first to the last char, reversed order  



website1 = "http://google.com"
website2 = "http://wikipedia.com"

slice = slice(7,-4)    # --> since where --> Here I want just the name of the site without 'http' and without 'com' (in this case 'm' is -1 and '.' it's -4)
print(website1[slice]) # --> call
