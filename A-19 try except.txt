#try-except 
 - block is used for handling exceptions. It allows the program to capture and manage exceptions that may occur during the execution of code.
 
 
 - try     --> In this block, we place the code that may raise an exception. 
               If an exception is raised during the execution of this code, the program goes to the corresponding except block.

 - except  --> This block defines how the program should handle the raised exception. 
               We can specify a specific type of exception (e.g., ExceptionType1) to be caught by this block. 
			   We can also use a general except block, which catches all types of exceptions. 
			   If the raised exception matches any of the except blocks, the code in that block will be executed.

 - else    --> (optional) - This block will be executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block. 
              It is a place where we can put code that needs to be executed when no exceptions occurred.

 - finally --> (optional) - This block will be executed always, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. 
              We can place code here that must be executed, regardless of the occurrence of exceptions (e.g., closing a file, database operations).

###Typically, only the try and except blocks are used, and the rest are optional.###

#EXAMPLE:
try:
# Code that may raise an exception
except:
# Code to handle a general exception
else:
# Code to be executed if no exceptions occurred
finally:
# Code that will always be executed, regardless of exceptions
